## What is it?

This is a shell repository for code to create classifiers for polarity

for the [@appliednlp](http://twitter.com/appliednlp) course.

## Why is it?

or [negative](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Marvin)---after all,
it might be useful for
[complaints departments](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Sirius_Cybernetcs_Corperation_Complaints_Department).
